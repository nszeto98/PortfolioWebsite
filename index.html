      <h2 class = "center">About Me</h2>
      <p>As an avid user of all things internet, I wanted to discover more on this technology that drives our daily lives.  I am learning more about software and development with each passing day.</p>
      <p>I always enjoyed working with others to find creative solutions to challenging problems.  As a Business Administration graduate, I always did well to work with others, and I'm always excited to be part of a team.
