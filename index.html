      <h2 class = "center">About Me</h2>
      <p>As an avid user of all things internet, I wanted to discover more on the technology that drives our daily lives.  I am learning more about software and development with each passing day.  I am most interested in combining software development with business aspects I learned during my studies. </p>
      <p>I always enjoyed working with others to find creative solutions to challenging problems.  As a Business Administration graduate, I always did well to work with others, and I'm always excited to be part of a team.  If you're looking for a developer, please contact me using the information <a href = "#contactMe">here</a>.</p>
